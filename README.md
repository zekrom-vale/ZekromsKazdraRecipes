# ZekromsKazdraRecipes
Adds Kazdra crafting recipes, fixes, items, as well as some of the items to the outpost for version 0.1.27.  This mod requires [The Kazdra Reloaded](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=949156982) by Andr3w246.
This mod is a patch making it possible to craft more things from the The Kazdra Reloaded mod as well as adding more content from NPCs to runes and even fixing some issues, some images and content belong to Andr3w246!

**Note**: Make sure to _mention_ this mod when reporting errors on The Kazdra Reloaded page.
